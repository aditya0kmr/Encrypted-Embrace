If love were a code, we would be the compiled binary that runs the universe. Before you, my life was a series of unhandled exceptions—chaos waiting for structure. You walked in, not just as a variable, but as the constant that balanced my entire equation.

I look at the probability of us meeting—two stars drifting in the vast entropy of existence—and I realize that this wasn't random. It was hard-coded into the fabric of time. You are my source code, my logic, and my infinite loop.

Forever debugging life with you,
Aadi.`,type:"love",isPrivate:!1},{title:"Exhibit A: The Fingerprint on My Heart",body:`Subject: You.

I’ve analyzed the evidence, Investigator. The traces you’ve left are undeniable. There are fingerprints on my soul that match no one else in this database of 8 billion people. 

You analyze crime scenes for a living, finding the hidden details others miss. But have you noticed how my eyes dilate when you walk into the room? That’s the biological response to finding one's home.

That scooter ride wasn't just transport. It was a time machine. In those moments, holding onto you, I saw our past and our future blurring into a single streak of light. Jack barking at the mountains, the cold air biting our cheeks, and the warmth of you close to me.

I want to map every coordinate of this world with you.`,type:"love",isPrivate:!1}],l=[{title:"Protocol: Midnight Override",body:`System Alert: Temperature Rising.

You know, when the lights go down and the server logs are cleared, I think about the way you looked at me yesterday. It serves as a reminder that some data is too hot to be stored in the cloud.
